# A number guessing game

## Goal
Create a program that will guess a number between 1 and 100 in a minimal amount of attempts. With a help of a second program calculate the average number of attempts needed to guess the right number over 1000 trials.

## Solution
The prediction algorithm uses binary search with NumPy array of all possible numbers.
